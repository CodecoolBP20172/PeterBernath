[8] - Summary
~~~~~~~~

I prepared 2 days the weekend before SI week for Lensa interview, then 2 days for Stylers and 2 days for Morgan Stanley. 
On my TW week I planned to learn how to use GraphQL on a sample project and try to implement it on my own project - Farmer's Market. 
As I got ill, 2 days fell out of my plan and I also got stuck in the middle of the sample project for GraphQL, so I spent half day debugging, 
that's the reason I could't finish the sample project on time.
